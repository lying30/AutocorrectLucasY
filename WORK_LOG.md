| march 21 |  1:45-3pm   | I guess I had an error with my edit distance method and it was returning 0 for all cases, so I used the period to fix that bug and I got the tabulation working. Then, Clifford helped me with the scanner thing and so i started to try and make the main method and ask for input. |
