| March 11    | 8:45am-10am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Thought through the problem as it was the first day of work time. |
| March 12-19 |     NA      |                                                                                                                                       We had about 1-2 other classes that I talked through ideas and thought about how to approach the problem with my peers. I think I forgot to fill in my work log because I didn't make much progress beyond thinking. |
| march 20    | 8:45am-10am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I did my edit distance method using tabulation. |
| march 21    |  1:45-3pm   |                                                                       I guess I had an error with my edit distance method and it was returning 0 for all cases, so I used the period to fix that bug and I got the tabulation working. Then, Clifford helped me with the scanner thing and so i started to try and make the main method and ask for input. |
| march 24    |  8pm-12am   | Implemented my main method and kept it pretty simple by just suggesting the top 5 words and then otherwise saying if the word is correct/found in the dictionary. Then, I went and commented my code and then called it there. I could've gone to further lengths to make my autocorrecter a little but more sophisticated but this one gets the job done. |
| March 25    | 12-12:30am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Spent 30 minutes doing the time complexity text file and the README 2.0 file for the submission. |
